# hubforwork
My current position requires quick access to multiple tools. Previously, we had no centralized hub. Now we have several but none were optimized for my position. I created my own file which I publish internally for anyone to use. This is a template that I will be using for the next version as I have learned a lot since I created the original file.

None of the elements will be properly labelled and the URLs will be dummy URLs to maintain security and privacy.
